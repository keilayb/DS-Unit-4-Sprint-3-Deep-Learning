This link will serve as our main resouce for understanding how LSTMs work. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_t = \\sigma(W_f \\cdot [h_{t-1},x_t]~+~b_f)$$\n",

    "This neuron's job is to use the current input to learn what new information to include in the cell state. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$i_t = \\sigma(W_i \\cdot [h_{t-1},x_t]~+~b_i)$$\n",

    "- If $i_t$'s value is closer to 1.0, then more information from the candidate cell state is retained. \n",

    "Finally, you combine the two scaled cell states to form the new cell state of the model. \n",

    "It is $C_t$ that will be passed into the next training step and used by the output to make a final prediction. \n",

    "Using sequential models to generate text data is a very popular application of recursive deep learning models. A couple of popular applications are [**chat bots**](https://hackernoon.com/deep-learning-chatbot-everything-you-need-to-know-r11jm30bc) and language translators such as [**google translate**](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/recent-advances-in-google-translate.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to properly build a chat bot or translater you need to use multiple lstm models in an encoder & decoder framwork known as a [**sequence 2 sequence model**](https://keras.io/examples/nlp/lstm_seq2seq/) .\n",

Transformers give seq2seq models the capacity to pay attention to specific portions of the input sequence, the most relevent portion in order to make a prediction. Yes, that's right, humanity has figured out how to convert attention into an algorithm. Next stop, self-awareness! \n",
    "\n",
    "The above mentions of sequence 2 sequence models and transformers are for a larger contextual understanding of the landscape of language models and how LSTMs fit into this landscape. Although **we will cover the endcoder/decoder framework in a future lesson, transformers are outside the scope of Unit 4**. However, once you learn about LSTMs and encoder/decoder frameworks, you will have all necessary information to then go on and learn about transformers on your own. At that point, the only really new bit you'll be learning is the [**attention mechanism**](https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitive-understanding-of-attention-mechanism-in-deep-learning-6c9482aecf4f). \n",
